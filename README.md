## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

As usual, you get started by cloning the project to your local machine:

```
$ git://github.com/Applicasa/Sample-App---Android.git
```

### Open and Run Project in eclipse

Now that you have cloned the repo:

1. open the project up in Eclipse.

2. Go to the project and link it with the Facebook library

3. Import the SupersonicAds to your workspace. 
**NOTE:** Not needed, SupersonicAds jar was added directly to the libs folder for you convenience. 

  A. File -> Import -> "Existing Projects into your workspace"
  
  B. Go to the path where you cloned the Repo: (repoFolder)\AdNetwork\SSA_production-sdk
  
  C. Link "AppVille" with the SupersonicAds SDK
	

4. Click on the project name "AppVilleEgg" -> "Android Tools" -> "Add Support library"

At this point, you *should* be able to build and run the project in the Android device or emulator.
